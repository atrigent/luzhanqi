CS4500-Luzhanqi
===============

For Northeastern University CS4500's semester project, students must create a
text based version of the game Luzhanqi. The software created can be in any
language, and will represent a single player in the game. There will be a
referee to communicate messages between the two players and verify all moves
made are valid. Information on moves, board layout, etc, will be sent to the
referee via standard out.

## Instructions:
###### Quoted from the Assignment 4 instructions, by William D. Clinger.

The rapid prototype does not need to be compiled.

It can be run by executing the command

    ./play4500 --go <n> --time/move <t>

as explained in the assignment, where <n> is 1 or 2, depending
on whether the player goes first or second (respectively),
and <t> is the time allowed per move, in any of these formats:

    2s
    2.0s
    2000ms
    2000.0ms

Example:

    ./play4500 --go 1 --time/move 1.2s

says the player goes first and will be given 1.2 seconds per
move.



## Testing
Tests can be run by executing the command

    python3 -m unittest discover test/
